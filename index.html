  This week we have to work in our groups and its been going well. We also did a boat challange for challange day. Our Rube Goldburg Machine had a screw,lever, and wheels.
  I love my group, its so much fun. When Mr.Poole wasnt here on thrusday, we did a E challange. We we're suppose to draw a E with measures and the switch with somebody and try to draw their E.
  I am looking forward to work with my group again and have fun!

     This is my fourth blog. This week Mr.Poole got covid so now he's not
     coming to school till he gets better. Last week we were finishing up with our projects, 
     my group did will. I'm proud of them. We have a sub her name is Ms.Erekson, she is very pretty.
     I hope Mr.Poole will get better soon.
